            <h2><em>What is Bullet Journaling?</em></h2>
            <p>
            Bullet journaling is a creative way to create an organization system in a notebook. You can use it to take notes, make to do lists, even turn it into a diary. It's become increasingly more popular over the years and its become a very popular choice of organizaiton that is regulalry posted on social media sites such as Instagram, YouTube, and even Facebook.&nbsp;
            <p>There is an endless amount of brands that make the "Ultimate bujo" and the supplies you can use are endless and I personally just started using a bullet journal this year, and its brought my collection of stationery to a dangerous level where I can now refer to myself as a Stationery Hoarder!</p>
