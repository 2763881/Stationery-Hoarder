            <h2><em>What is Bullet Journaling?</em></h2>
            <p class="1">
                Bullet journaling is a creative way to create an organization system in a notebook. You can use it to take notes, make to do lists, even turn it into a diary. It's become increasingly more popular over the years and its become a very popular choice of organizaiton that is regulalry posted on social media sites such as Instagram, YouTube, and even Facebook.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p class="1">There is an endless amount of brands that make the "Ultimate bujo" and the supplies you can use are endless and I personally just started using a bullet journal this year, and its brought my collection of stationery to a dangerous level where I can now refer to myself as a Stationery Hoarder!</p>

        <article><h1 class="a">Subscription Boxes</h1>
            <p class="1"> The idea of subscription boxes isn't a new one they've existed for years however with the increasing popularity of utilizing social media on a daily basis. The use of subscription boxes has increased exponentially and with the growing popularity of stationery a lot of companies have started making subscription boxes for stationery hoarders like myself. Now while there are a lot of different subscription boxes I personally am only subscribed to two of them.

            <div id="b"><p>
                The first subscription box I acquired was Panduh Box which is provided by a company called Paper Panduh. Paper Panduh is a stationery company that carries a wide variety of stationery products. Varying from all kinds of stickers that are typically used for a variety of planners to washi tape. So far I have just recieved my March Box from them and I got a wide variety of stickers some of which were super useful to me and others that were not. However I have a friend that like using his planner almost as much as I do so I gave them to him. Between the packaging and the products I'm a huge fan of the products that panduh box provides and given that its only $19.99 a month its a phenomenal price considering how many items you get for it.

            <div id="bee"><img src="images/busybee.png" alt="busy bee stationery logo">
                <p> The other subscription box that I just recently started getting is Busy Bee Stationery Box. While this box is a bit pricier than Panduh Box the items you get differ so much. I got multiple pens, a pencil case, and a giant container of stamps and ink as well as washi tape! While it does cost $39.99 a month it was still so fun to see everything I got in this box and to see how different all of the items are from one another. I love both of these boxes and I'm definitely going to continue being subscribed to both boxes after this.
